unity-platformer (work name)
===

It's based on https://github.com/SebLague/2DPlatformer-Tutorial

Expanded fixing some edge cases and improving overall experience.
* fix MovingPlatform issues, that allow player to fall though
* fix minor slope issues to handle better "below-collision" far from perfect
but i can jump while on slope down more times.
* add ladder (very simple)
* add some distance to env, to better handle collisions, that gap it's really useful.
