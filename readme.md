===

Based on https://github.com/SebLague/2DPlatformer-Tutorial evolve
in it's own beast.

This project is 5.5, I cannot garantee 5.4 compatibility of Assets but code
should be OK.

## API documentation

A package will be available soon, when everything is rather stable.

I don't even have develop/master setup... there is no stable version
I'm still developing and reshaping the API.
